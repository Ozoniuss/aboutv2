        <h2>Go interfaces bypass cyclic dependencies</h2>

        <p>
            Yes, that's right. I figured it out while reading Teiva Harsanyi's book <a
                href="https://www.manning.com/books/100-go-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them">100 Go Mistakes and How to
                Avoid them.</a> And this is due to interfaces being satisfied implicitly, unlike languages like Java
            where they have to be declared explicitly with the implements keyword. But what does this even mean, and why
            would it be useful?
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll illustrate what this means through a simple dumb example. Say we have some client that prints hello
            to its users when registering. So you would have a function like:
            <code class="gocode">
func PrintHello(){ 
    fmt.Println("hello client")
}
            </code>
            However maybe to some clients you want to print the message in a different format, perhaps colored or with
            different text styling. In the client code you could define the following interface:
            <code class="gocode">
type helloPrinter interface {
    PrintHello()
}
            </code>
            Now you can implement the <code>PrintHello()</code> function in various ways. But let's assume you want to
            use the implementation of some existing package, for example, a fictional <code>color</code> package. Assume
            that the color package provides structs such as <code>GreenPrinter</code> and <code>YellowPrinter</code>
            where each define the method <code>PrintHello()</code>. Since interfaces are implemented implicitly in Go,
            it means that you could simply import these structs in your client code and use them as a
            <code>helloPrinter</code> to define some funtions:
            <code class="gocode">
func Print(h helloPrinter) {
    h.PrintHello()
}

func PrintHelloRed() {
    p := color.GreenPrinter{}
    p.PrintHello()
}

func PrintHelloYello() {
    p := color.YellowPrinter{}
    p.PrintHello()
}
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            But, where is the dependency cycle? Well, your <code>client</code> package needs the
            <code>YellowPrinter</code> and the <code>GreenPrinter</code> structs from the <code>color</code> package.
            But at the same time, if you had to explicitly implement the interface such as in Java, the
            <code>color</code> package would have had to import the <code>helloPrinter</code> interface from the client
            package, thus creating a dependency cicle. The implicit implementation avoided this dependency cicle, while
            also putting fuel on my irrational hate I have for Java (seriously, what's going on with that language...)
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that, I'm pretty sure there must be a way to do something similar in other languages, but nothing came
            to mind when I wrote this.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, one more benefit is that the client can implement its own printers, in addition to using
            existing ones. See the <a
                href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/blog-examples/tree/main/go-interfaces-bypass-cyclic-dependencies/hello-printer-go">full
                working example</a> on my github. It includes a <code>ReversePrinter</code> implementation of
            <code>HelloPrinter</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, the example above is out of thin air and while it serves as a proof-of-concept, it's not
            indicative of any actual real-world example. I personally wrote this more of as an interesting fact, but
            this approach can lead to some nice design possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            The book I linked above discusses best practices of locating the definition of an interface in a project.
            Particularly, this approach makes it possible to introudce an interface definition in the client code, whose
            implementation may in fact be found in existing go packages. This is outside the scope of this post, as I
            just wanted to show the mechanism, but I definitely recommend reading the book.
