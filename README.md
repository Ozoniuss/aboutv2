# Aboutme

Initially, this project was hosted on one of my personal laptops, and I was
keeping it closed source to avoid giving out any possible ways of attacking it.
Being so overwhelmed by all the fame it brought me took away all the time I was
going to spend on setting up top-notch security (/s). Now that I moved to cloud
providers where protection was a given, I decided to open source it, leaving
here only the data that is also displayed on the website. Another advantage is
that now this repository becomes the source of truth for the website, so I can
basically:

- switch computers without having to worry about syncing them too much;
- create a basic pipeline which updates my website whenever I push;
- get feedback more easily on my shitty HTML, CSS, Javascript trinity whilst
  also simplifying the collaboration with other people.

The source code here leaves a lot to be desired, but since this is written in
my free time and the quest of discovering the fronted lore is not even in the
funding phase yet, I will accept the shame. While looking at it almost brings
a tear to my eye, I've accepted that there are more important things to focus
on, such as my writing style, the availability and not ending up with a bigass
bill in the mail for something that's supposed to be free (because remember,
nothing is _really_ free). Spending time on cleaning the pillars of a building
that's already standing is something I invested a lot on effort in learning how
**NOT** to do.

The plans for this project will be in the issues section of this repository.
