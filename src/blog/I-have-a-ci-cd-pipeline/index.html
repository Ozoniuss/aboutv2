        <h2>I finally have a Github CI/CD pipeline to update my site automatically</h2>

        <p>
            I was planning to do this for quite some time now. In fact, I've had an open issue for this <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/aboutv2/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for the last 6 months.</a> I really slacked on the website lately, mainly because I was going through some issues at work, and have tried experimenting with Github pages as an alternative. But I finally found another use case that would be perfect for the website, which prompted me to finally get the CI/CD pipeline done with.
        </p>

            The idea is simple: my site is a static website in Backblaze B2 powered by Cloudflare (I'll explain in some post how I did it). Any changes to the bucket would eventually be reflected on the published website. So the idea is pretty simple: keep the bucket synced with the Github repository. This comes for granted with solutions like Github pages, but when I first did the website I had an unhealthy desire to do everything from scratch, so I have to implement simple things like this by myself. But hey, at least I practice my yaml skills.

            I originally wanted to do this with rclone, mainly because I have experience with it. That's how I've been syncing my website manually so far. But, rclone requires a config file to read the remotes you have access to, and I've configured several remotes. I know you can store secrets in Github, but I didn't want my whole config to be there, just in case. I wasn't able to find an easy way to configure rclone to be able to interact only with a single remote (such as maybe setting some env vars for the commands, idk) so I looked for an alternative. Luckily, Backblaze does have a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-command-line-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI tool</a> which allows you to sync your files easily, whilst also configuring authorization for a single bucket. This is what I went with.

        <p>
            The script is pretty simple and runs whenever I make a new commit. You can find it below.
            <code class="blockcode">
name: Backblaze B2 Sync

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  backblaze-cli-sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install b2 CLI tool
        run: |
          pip install b2 --log /dev/null

      - name: Sync all files that have a different size
        run: |
          b2 sync --compare-versions size --delete ./src/ "b2://ozoniusswebsite/"

        env:
          B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
          B2_APPLICATION_KEY: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
            </code>Honeslty probably the real reason for which I've made this post is to test that the site is updated with this new page.
