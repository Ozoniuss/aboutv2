        <h2>What encoding should I use?</h2>

        <p>
            This is not going to be a dive into how different encodings work (well, maybe a bit, just to illustrate certains aspects). I just finished reading the chapter "Encoding and Evolution" from the famous "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" book, and I wanted to write up a short summary of what I feel like I learned. And curiously, it's not necessarily about encodings in general.

            key ideas:

            - easy to change
            - the flavours are at storage level and at application level
            - schemas are useful for reducing storage toll, but make it harder to preserve forwards or backwards compatibility
            - there are different flavours of backwards compatibility
            - code generation in dyanmically typed languages
            - whether a rolling update is possible depends on backwards compatibility AND forwards compatibility AND some intermediary compatibility (new, w) -> (old, r) -> (old,w)
            - data outlives code
