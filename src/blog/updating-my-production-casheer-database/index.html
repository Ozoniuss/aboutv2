        <h2>Updating my production Casheer database</h2>

        <p>
            I've started using <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casheer</a> to manage my expenses for a month now, and I have one month's worth of expenses. Sadly, I realised that I didn't like the way I store entries, and I wanted to be consistent and allow for different currencies and exponents there as well (see my <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer/tree/main/currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rant</a> about how to store monetary values). But, this meant I had to actually update my database production. Of course, it's easy to copy an SQL database if things go wrong, I mean, you have means to test your migrations even in big production environments before actually doing the migration. But it feels nice knowing that I have data that I care about, in a database, that I have to update.
        </p>

        <p>
            The process was quite straightforward. There is no point in talking about zero downtime migrations in my case (but there is a <a href="https://teamplify.com/blog/zero-downtime-DB-migrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice article</a> I recommend reading anyway), but I still wanted to follow best practices for migrations to simulate a real-world environment. Basically, I had to rename one column, and then add two more non-nullable columns which would both store the same value for the entries that I had already created (which is not necessarily the same value).
        </p>

        <p>
            Usually, you'd do such a migration like this: <code class="blockcode">

-- transaction so you don't fuck things up and can do
-- selects to inspect your new data
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

ALTER TABLE entries
RENAME COLUMN expected_total TO amount;

-- first, do not make columns nullable because they don't have
-- a default value
ALTER TABLE entries
ADD COLUMN exponent INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE entries
ADD COLUMN currency TEXT COLLATE NOCASE;

-- all my entries were in RON, with exponent 2.
-- but note that's not necessarily a default value
ALTER TABLE entries
SET exponent = -2
WHERE 1=1;

ALTER TABLE entries
SET currency = 'RON'
WHERE 1=1;

-- add the NOT NULL constraint now
ALTER TABLE entries
ALTER COLUMN currency SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE entries
ALTER COLUMN exponent SET NOT NULL;

COMMIT;
            </code> Unfortunately, SQLite <a href="https://www.sql-easy.com/learn/sqlite-not-null-constraint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not make it easy</a> for you to simply add a NOT NULL constraint (or change the column's characteristics, really), the alternative being to copy the entire table data to a temporary table, remove the original table and rename the temporary one. But, that seemed cumbersome so I just ended up doing the following: <code class='blockcode'>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

ALTER TABLE entries
RENAME COLUMN expected_total TO amount;

ALTER TABLE entries
ADD COLUMN exponent INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT -2;

ALTER TABLE entries
ADD COLUMN currency TEXT COLLATE NOCASE NOT NULL DEFAULT 'RON';

COMMIT;
            </code> The defaults don't bother me that much, as the app sets them anyway to those values. I should've probably done this for the other two tables as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, I also included the corresponding script that reverts those changes, which is a pattern that helps me reverting all the changes without having to create a new database. I'm still wondering if this is more efficient than dropping the entire database and creating a new one, but it has the advantage of allowing you to do a partial revert over your data. Having <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer/tree/main/scripts/sqlite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these scripts</a> is a pattern I'm using to run my <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer/blob/main/test_e2e.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end to end tests.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Here I've only talked about the database changes, but changing the code also cost me half a Sunday. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer/commit/cdb358cb945851deb26fe1bb2ede08b17782f6b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commit</a> for reference.
