            <b>What is this about?</b> I like talking about stuff. I have a strong need to share the things I learn with people.
            This is exactly what I'm going to use this for, to pass my stories around, be they about math, coding, my learnings,
            my life stores, guitar, whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note before.</b> If you reached this place, welcome! Happy to have you around. But first and foremost, this place
            stores <b>my</b> thoughts and opinions. Don't take everything too seriously -- I don't believe that my opinions are always
            the only correct ones. I am always very open to new perspectives. Also, I will tend to let my emotions be reflected
            in the phrasing. If you don't enjoy that, I'm much more careful with the wording on <a
            href="https://medium.com/@ozoniuss" target="_blank">Medium.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
