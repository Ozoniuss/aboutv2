      This page is dedicated to my work. I'm not sure exactly how I want this to look like, and there's quite a good chance it will change often. It's not going to be something like a place to redirect people when I'm asked questions like "What do you value in your workplace" or "What are you good at and what are you bad at", even if it's starting to sound like a good idea the more I say it out loud. Rather, it's going to help me figure this out for myself. In 2023 I was put many times in the (unfortunate) situation of having to answer these questions "correctly", and I realised that my answer's weren't really consistent and mostly depended on the place I was applying for. But now, I feel like I started building my own personality. So I guess I'll go over a bunch of recurring themes that I can now analyze with a fresh pair of eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What do you value most in your worksplace?</b> I think this one is by far the easiest, and no, it's not working with Go or doing complex algorithms or whatever similar bullshit. It's the people you work with. I spend much more time at work than I do with my girlfriend, my friends or my family, working on things I enjoy in my free time, or simply relaxing at home. It better be with the right people.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a long time, I thought that I must be using some langauge I liked, or constantly tackling difficult challenges in order to be excited to get out of bed and get straight to that laptop. And don't get me wrong, I really enjoy that. In fact, I still do it very often. Many times after a full's day work, I get straight on the laptop when I come home and do coding challenges. I go to bed reading about concurrency models or trying to solve some math problems mentally. But, in time, I've realised that those are rather things I like doing on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had the opportunity to work on very complex stuff at work. And that's pretty much at every place I worked at. And I spent quite some nights doing work-related work in my free time because the problem was interesting. Or at least, that's what I thought. It seems more and more obvious now that I was enjoying the fact that it became easier for me to prove myself rather than the actual challenge I was taking up. I would dream of myself being in a meeting and having a lot of things to say; of sounding interesting and knowledgeable in general. But that rarely happened. However, that was never the case with the things I was working on for myself, like algorithms, or maths, or weird code experiments. I could get completely sunk in thoughts for hours working on those things, just because I love it so much and not because I was trying to prove a point.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's not to say the complex work was not enjoyable. But not being on the same page with my colleagues was definitely not enjoyable. And not only that, but it would also take away from the joy of solving work challenges. If I think about it, there's no particular reason I can attribute the rather poor state of our relationship to. In most cases we were even passionate about similar things. Hell, one of these guys is still by far the most gifted developer I ever worked with. We just didn't "click" professionally. We had different visions of teamwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things changed once I joined a company where teamwork was one of the core values and I was surrounded by a lot of people that had one of the strongest relationship I've ever seen. The mentality started to shift drastically from wanting to prove yourself in isolation to being part of a collective where you own things together, ship things together, take blame together. The notion of "I" suddenly changed into "we". Equally to all complex services we worked on, the team health was something that a lot of effort was put in to keep pristine. And there's even more to it than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      I haven't evolved professionally just by learning intricate concepts and technologies all by myself. And I did that a lot, and I still do it regularly. That got me (what I think are without trying to be too modest) great technical and analytical skills, but I didn't feel that much growth as a software engineer. The moment I truly started to understand what this job is about is when I got put in this large team, that were also mostly senior+ engineers with lots of experience. It's great to have a mentor guiding you through your path, but I'd argue seeing how seasoned people approach problems, prioritize tasks, engage in arguments and so on is even better. You don't experience something that's more or less taylored to yourself; you experience the real deal. What you signed up for when deciding to spend most of your life in front of a screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now obviously, I made this sound like a pipe dream; that was the intention. I wanted to communicate how I feel, not paint an exact image of the reality, but I'm still not far from the truth. There are always going to be small conflicts, there are always going to be misalingments, there are always going to be prefer that have a slight preference of working with certain other people. But there's just no way to avoid that. That's why we have things like retros, and that's why we keep working on the relationship. The eulogistic description so far is meant to showcase the difference I felt between working at places where I didn't fit in, and at places where I felt just the opposite way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand now why companies do behavioural interviews. And they should. And I'm starting to understand less and less all the technical only interviews I had in the past, and I'm not at all short of those. Honestly, if I were hiring for a team, I could sacrifice technical excellence for a like-minded bandmate. It goes without saying that your mileage may vary depending on the role requirements but I find that this statement could generally be a good rule of thumb in a team where you already have at least some great developers.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions I plan to answer soon or have partially answered</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Ok, but what are you good at?</b> Answering this would be valuable because it would make me reflect about my skills and realize which part I want to invest in improving. It's going to help me settle priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What do you think about mastering a programming language?</b> This had been on my mind quite some time. Go is the programming language I love and I'm proeficient in, to the level that I could probably use it without internet. I always envisioned myself as being that "Go guy" that people come to if they have questions about the language, or that guy who would quickly glance over some Go code and figure out problems right away. I still really like Go and enjoy reading about its internals, playing with profilers, knowing the standards of writing code, knowing the active open source projects, following releases and all that jazz, but my view regarding this question has started to entertain the probability that it's probably not the best idea to romanticise a single language and strive to master it.
    </p>

    <p>
      All languages were designed with an idea in mind, and built upon some principles. I'm much more interested now to see what was the reason languages were designed a certain way, rather than blindly embracing Go as the GOd given way to program. Even though runtime implementations and memory models may differ vastly between languages, core ideologies that lay underneath stay the same. Implementations may change, making mastering a language an endless process of continuous documentation. Core ideas stay the same, but yet they're probably the most important blocks you have to take into account to reason about a variety of things such as performance, ease of use and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Scrum? XP? Pair programming? What is the best way to work together?</b> I want to research this further by reading more about these methodologies, or at least the problems they intend to solve. At the moment I have experience with Scrum, XP (Kanban + Pair Programming) and what I like to call "Freestyling" (syncing and discussing without any particular structure), and I seem to agree that the approach that works the best is the one where all team members are aligned with the same philosophy (aka "ways of working"). In some teams that could be Scrum, in others XP, and in others Freestyling. I know people who claim that each of those is the best for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personally I don't particularly care as much, though I consider I haven't really benefited from the ceremonies of Scrum. To me estimations with Fibonacci, sprints and all those gatherings seemed like just some extra boilerplate that would eventually lead to the same team conversations without all the additional meeting boilerplate. But I only did Scrum in a startup with inexperienced people and no manager, and I'm pretty confident we didn't get it all right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Should developers know infrastructure or databases?</b> The short answer is yes, but I feel like the discussion here is going to be long and I don't have all the arguments in my mind yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What do you think about University</b> There's a common culture where I live and probably in many other places that University is useless and doesn't teach you real skills that are applicable to a software engineering job. I'm going to be controversial and I will say that couldn't be further from the truth. And that is coming from someone that back in University could give a fuck about this field and just wanted to get a passing grade and the degree. I willingly put a lot of effort into my Master's, because it's something I came to enjoy.
