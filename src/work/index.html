      Working together means it's important so share some core values. Very briefly, mine would be:
    <ul>
      <li>curiosity</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>trust</li>
      <li>efficiency</li>
      <li>meaning</li>
      <li>passion</li>
      <li>solve</li>
    </ul>
    Which is basically "cd temps" if you just take the first letter. Easy to remember. Let's briefly discuss each.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, we work in a field where we can't afford to stagnate. Technology is always changing at a very fast
      pace and in order to adapt, we need to stay <b>curious.</b> There is no point where you know enough to stop
      learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a <b>data-driven</b> person. I understand that some decisions have to be made based on feeling, but when you
      have data available, you should use it to your advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      I find the most important trait of a high-performing team is not good processes but rather <b>trust</b> amongst
      its members. That means owning both the good things and the bad things. We should cherish achievements together
      but we should also accept that we sometimes make mistakes, and share the learnings from failures.
    </p>

    <p>
      I value my time and I'm sure you value yours. I'm obsessed with trying to use my time in the most <b>efficient</b>
      way possible. If you end up stuck for 30 minutes once, there will always be something else to work on. If it keeps
      happening, we need to discuss what needs to change in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care about working on software that is <b>meaningful.</b> The journey of building will always be fun, but
      nothing replaces the feeling you get when you see your work actually being useful to other people.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like working with people that are <b>passionate</b> about what they do. There's a certain kind of energy you get
      from talking to them. It just makes you feel more energized.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always been a <b>problem solver.</b> Not sure if that comes from years of maths contests, but I get
      very excited from finding a solution to a difficult problem. To me, that's what software engineering is all about
      in the end, and I think we should remind ourselves what the end goal is before we get attached to our own
      solutions.
    </p>

      If this list resonates with you and your team then we may be a good fit to work together. Hit me up at <a
        href="mailto:alexxbledea@gmail.com">alexxbledea@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in a collaboration. I'm
      currently not looking for full-time work.
