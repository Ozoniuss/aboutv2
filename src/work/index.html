      This page is dedicated to my work. I'm not sure exactly how I want this to look like, and there's quite a good chance it will change often. It's not going to be something like a place to redirect people when I'm asked questions like "What do you value in your workplace" or "What are you good at and what are you bad at", even if it's starting to sound like a good idea the more I say it out loud. Rather, it's going to help me figure this out for myself. In 2023 I was put many times in the (unfortunate) situation of having to answer these questions "correctly", and I realised that my answer's weren't really consistent and mostly depended on the place I was applying for. But now, having found a job where I am lucky enough to work with outstanding engineers that are also extremely technically skilled, I started to shape up my own ethos. So I guess I'll go over a bunch of recurring themes that I can now analyze with a fresh pair of eyes.

      <b>What do you value most in your worksplace?</b> I think this one is by far the easiest, and no, it's not working with Go or doing complex algorithms or whatever similar shit like that. It's the people you work with. I spend much more time at work than I do with my girlfriend, my friends or my family, so it better be with the right people.

      For a long time, I thought that I must be using some langauge I liked, or constantly tackling difficult challenges in order to achieve workplace Nirvana.

      I haven't evolved professionally just by learning intricate concepts and technologies all by myself. And I did that a lot, and I still do it regularly. That got me (what I think are without trying to be too modest) great technical and analytical skills, but I didn't feel that much growth as a software engineer. The moment I truly started to understand what this job is about is when I got put in a large team full of senior+ engineers. It's a great thing to have a mentor guiding you through your path, but I'd argue seeing how seasoned people approach problems, prioritize tasks, engage conversations and debate arguments is even better. You don't experience something taylored to yourself; you get to experience the real thing.

      <b>Ok, but what are you good at?</b>
      Finding bussiness value. Knowing when to stop looking for a better solutiion,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What do you think about mastering a programming language</b> Go is the programming language I love and I'm proeficient in, to the level that I could probably use it without internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Scrum? XP? Pair programming? What is the best way to work together?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What do you think about University</b> There's a common culture where I live and probably in many other places that University is useless and doesn't teach you real skills that are applicable to a software engineering job. I'm going to be controversial and I will say that couldn't be further from the truth. And that is coming from someone that back in University could give a fuck about this field and just wanted to get a passing grade and the degree.
