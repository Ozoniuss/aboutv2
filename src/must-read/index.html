                        engineer (Gergely Orosz)</a> is the best publication for following the latest news in tech. It's
                    pricey at 15$ a month but worth every penny IMO. Have a read before forwarding bullshit AI

                    from LinkedIn bros.

                    development process as a company and how to improve as a software engineer. This is what I am
                    personally
                    looking for in a team.

                    does a lot of videos focusing on good coding practices. They are mostly beginner-friendly but I
                    still
                    find them very enjoyable and easy to watch and he puts out content regularly.

                    <a href="https://medium.com/@carloarg02/about">Carlos Arguelles</a> has a lot of articles, mostly
                    focusing on comparing culture between Google and Amazon (and Microsoft to a small extent). But if
                    you
                    read their articles, do keep in mind that he's very biased towards Amazon. I still find them
                    enjoyable.

                    Please note that this is not a recommendation to get a Medium subscription, or read from Medium in
                    general. Medium has some good authors but in general it's filled with garbage click-bait or
                    rage-bait
                    content. I only write on Medium because it was very simple to get started and publications help with
                    reach, but I will give it up either for substack or my own blog if I get some time to set it up
                    properly.

                    which
                    variable to actually use if you define multiple ones with the same name. And different languages
                    handle
                    it differently.

                    mental model of what concurrency is in programming languages. You will find it much easier to
                    understand
                    how you can have multiple threads running on a single core and also how you can have a
                    single-threaded
                    runtime (Javascript) use multiple cores.
