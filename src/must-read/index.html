            This is just a dump of all the articles I think are worth reading.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Most of the stuff from <a href="https://stanford-cs242.github.io/f19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for theoretical programming language design.

            <li>
                <a href="https://willcrichton.net/notes/specificity-programming-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About name resolution</a>. How do you know which variable is in use if it was declared in multiple places?

            I don't have lots of experience with OOP. In fact, I've never worked professionally with an OOP language. This can either be a blessing or a curse, but I like to think of it as a blessing (as of now, I don't see the advantages you get with regular classes prompting me to no longer use Go). However, I do find knowing OOP to be <em>interesting.</em> I think the book <a href="http://https://stroustrup.com/4th.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> "Bjarne Stroustrup - The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition-Addison-Wesley Professional (2013)"</a> is an useful read. Haven't finished it, but like it so far. Particularly, points of interest:

                It's possible to go around the privacy imposed by OOP, page 454

            <li>
                The keyword "explicit" when declaring a constructor has a different meaning than what I remembered. It's in fact now allowing it to be used in an implicit conversion. This is a whole other complicated topic in C++. Good practices with single-argument constructors, page 458
