                    focusing on comparing culture between Google and Amazon (and Microsoft to a small extent). But if
                    you
                    read their articles, do keep in mind that he's very biased towards Amazon. I still find them
                    enjoyable.

                    Please note that this is not a recommendation to get a Medium subscription, or read from Medium in
                    general. Medium has some good authors but in general it's filled with garbage click-bait or
                    rage-bait
                    content. I only write on Medium because it was very simple to get started and publications help with
                    reach, but I will give it up either for substack or my own blog if I get some time to set it up
                    properly.

                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Mutexes from scratch</a> is a great in-depth low-level
                            article about how mutexes are implemented and why it's often a combination between runtime
                            checks and OS-level system calls to use OS-level locks. It also introduced <a

                            article was so good it made me follow the author.

                            example of actions taken during the incident to mitigate it and after the incident to make
                            the system more resilient. Tests and metrics are truly your friend. The part where I would
                            have liked the author to Go into more details was how they actually deployed the fixes as
                            they were talking about not being able to restart production they did make code changes and
                            deploy them in order to mitigate, which makes me wonder how this could have been done with
                            no restarts.

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">What color is your function?</a> is an (older) rant from the Dart
                    author about <code>async/await.</code> To be honest, I feel it's a valid rant. Personally, I always
                    found it harder to reason about asynchronous programming than to explicitly write the logic in the
                    style of traditional "threads" (I'm not talking about OS-level threads as most languages have some
                    lightweight version of "threads" with cheap context-switch). Go is my favourite concurrency model,
                    which seems to resonate with the author.
