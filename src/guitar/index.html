      I only added a small amount of music. This page will get bigger as I'm going through all my recordings. I'm also
      posting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ozoniuss1463">YouTube.</a>

          A track that keeps building up to a great ending. Wrote it at the end of 2024 but I kept thinking I would add
          more ideas which never happen.

          A funky groove I recorded with one of my buddies. It didn't end up being a song but at least it ended up being
          catchy.

          One of my best mixes. Started from noodling around with some chords in Cmaj. So far, still the best two guitar
          tones I have in terms of how they blend together.

          Something about this riff made me feel like it would be in a legendary movie. I ended up making an intro with
          it that I never developed further.

          I was listening to a lot of Polyphia back then and I tried to do something that's both crunchy and chordy.
          This is what came out.

          One of my favourite riffs from 2019, re-recorded after I started to sound good. Better tone, better guitarist.

          One of the things I composed after I learned to strum guitar. The original version is from around 2018 and

          My first ever recorded solo, shortly after I learned the pentatonic. The tune I found in A minor actually

          Second thing I ever recorded. Quality is a bit more decent but still needed to figure out the timing (well, I

          The very first thing I recorded using my Boss Katana Head MkII. I had practiced the riff since the pandemic
          started. Not the best quality but was super happy with my first ever drums!
