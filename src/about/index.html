            My name is Alex. Online, I go by the name of <b>Ozoniuss</b>. The story of this name comes from back in the days when I was doing math contests. Basically, we came up with a theorem called "Ozoniuss' theorem" that
            you can use once in a lifetime as a correct proof to any exercise. The hard part was figuring out when to
            actually use it.

            If you're new here, hi! Why don't you get to know me better? Here are some things about me. One of them is a lie -- can you spot which one?
            <ul>
                <li>I have a weird humour. You'd have a hard time figuring out if I'm joking or not. Why don't you try below?</li>
                <li>I enjoy learning new things</li>
                <li>I'd probably be a mathematician, if that was a real job in my country</li>
                <li>I actually used Ozoniuss' theorem in one math contest</li>
                <li>I find that distributed systems are like the complicated math problems of computer science</li>
                <li>I call my girlfriend "bro"</li>
                <li>I find that pretty much all coding patterns are just a form of refactoring duplicate code and defining purposeful abstractions with meaningful interfaces (aka Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion).</li>
                <li>I love Go as a programming language. If I were to master a language, it would be this one</li>
                <li>I should do much more open source than I am currently doing</li>
                <li>I'm doing algorithm problems just for fun</li>
                <li>I like writing. Read my <a href="https://medium.com/@ozoniuss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a></li>
                <li>I miss going to contests</li>
                <li>I didn't take programming seriously until I was 21. In fact, the only reason I pursued a CS degree is because a friend of mine also did</li>
                <li>I regret not paying more attention to university. Fundamentals are fundamentals and you need them at some point</li>
                <li>I play guitar. My favourite thing to do on guitar is procrastinating</li>
                <li>Even if my friends think I'm programming all day, I DO have a life</li>
                <li>I have an <a href="https://www.laotie.zone/LAOTIE--ES10P-2000W-Dual-Power-28_8Ah-21700-Battery-52V-10-Inches-Folding-Electric-Scooter-with-Seat-100km-Mileage-Max-Load-120kg-p-1752776.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric scooter.</a> Helps getting fast between places</li>
