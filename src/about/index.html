            My name is Alex. Online, I go by the name of <b>Ozoniuss</b>. The story of this name comes from back in the days when I was doing math contests. Basically, we came up with a theorem called "Ozoniuss' theorem" that
            you can use once in a lifetime as a correct proof to any exercise. Yeah I know, pretty dumb. At least I got a nickname out of it.

            Get to know me. One of the below is a lie.
            <ul>
                <li>I have a weird humour. You'd have a hard time figuring out if I'm joking or not. Why don't you try below?</li>
                <li>I'd probably be a mathematician, if that was a real job in my country</li>
                <li>I actually used Ozoniuss' theorem in one math contest when I didn't know how to solve a problem</li>
                <li>I like theoretical distributed systems. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Reliable-Secure-Distributed-Programming/dp/3642152597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this book</a> and you'll like them too.</li>
                <li>I love Go as a programming language. But, I'll probably love Rust more</li>
                <li>I should do much more open source than I am currently doing</li>
                <li>I'm doing algorithm problems just for fun. "Grinding leetcode" makes me happy</li>
                <li>I like writing. Read my <a href="https://medium.com/@ozoniuss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a></li>
                <li>I didn't take programming seriously until I was 21. In fact, the only reason I pursued a CS degree is because a friend of mine also did</li>
                <li>I play guitar. My favourite thing to do on guitar is procrastinating</li>
                <li>Even if my friends think I'm programming all day, I DO have a life</li>
                <li>I have an <a href="https://www.laotie.zone/LAOTIE--ES10P-2000W-Dual-Power-28_8Ah-21700-Battery-52V-10-Inches-Folding-Electric-Scooter-with-Seat-100km-Mileage-Max-Load-120kg-p-1752776.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric scooter.</a> Helps getting fast between places</li>
