            My name is Alex. Online, I go by the name of <b>Ozoniuss</b>. The story of this name comes from back in the days when I was doing math contests. There used to be a running joke that if we didn't know how to justify a part of a solution, we'd write something like "from Ozoniuss's theorem, we can deduce [that part]" hoping that the dude grading it would fall for it. Yeah I know, 13 year olds. But imagine if someone actually fell for that: it would've been fucking hilarious. Probably the best math contest story ever.

            Originally I did this page to show off my software skills to help me get hired. But I realised that's kinda cringy and I have my resume for that (or, probably the real reason, I got hired), so I changed it. Instead, here are some things about me:
            <ul>
                <li>I enjoy learning new things.</li>
                <li>I have a weird humour. You'd have a hard time figuring out if I'm joking or not</li>
                <li>I'd probably be a mathematician, if that wasn't a joke in my country</li>
                <li>I find that distributed systems are the complicated math problems of computer science</li>
                <li>I find that pretty much all coding patterns are just a form of refactoring duplicate code and defining purposeful abstractions with meaningful interfaces (aka Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion).</li>
                <li>I love Go as a programming language. If I were to master a language, it would be this one</li>
                <li>I should do much more open source than I am currently doing</li>
                <li>I'm doing algorithm problems just for fun</li>
                <li>I miss going to contests</li>
                <li>I didn't really take programming seriously until I was 21</li>
                <li>I regret not paying more attention to university. I found out the hard way that I lacked programming fundamentals, and I had to learn them anyway by myself.</li>
                <li>I play guitar. My favourite thing to do on guitar is procrastinating</li>
                <li>Even if my friends think I'm programming all day, I DO have a life</li>
                <li>I have an <a href="https://www.laotie.zone/LAOTIE--ES10P-2000W-Dual-Power-28_8Ah-21700-Battery-52V-10-Inches-Folding-Electric-Scooter-with-Seat-100km-Mileage-Max-Load-120kg-p-1752776.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>electric scooter. I just can't see my life without it in my town's fucking traffic</li>
            </ul>
